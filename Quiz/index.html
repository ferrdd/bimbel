					Horse owners who plan to breed one or more mares should have a working
					knowledge of heredity and know how to care for breeding animals and
					foals. The number of mares bred that conceive varies from about 40 to
					85 percent, with the average running less than 50 percent. Some mares
					that do conceive fail to produce living foals. This means that, on
					average, two mares are kept a whole year to produce one foal, and even
					then, some foals are disappointments from the standpoint of quality.
					By careful selection, breeders throughout history have developed
					various kinds of horses with a wide variety of characteristics to suit
					many different needs. The Great Horse of the Middle Ages, for example,
					was bred for size and strength to carry a heavily armored knight. The
					massive horses of such breeds are often called "cold blooded." The
					Arabs bred lithe desert horses that were small and swift. These
					animals are often referred to as "hot blooded". Cross-breeding of
					hot-blooded and cold-blooded horses for certain characteristics
					produced breeds ranging from riding horses to draft horses. The
					Thoroughbred is considered by many to be the highpoint of elegance and
					fine selective breeding. Many persons mistakenly apply the name
					Thoroughbred to any purebred horse. But a Thoroughbred is a distinct
					breed of running horses that traces its ancestry through the male line
					directly back to three Eastern stallions as the Byerly Turk, the
					Darley Arabian, and the Godolphin Barb. For convenience the breeds of
					horses are often divided into three major groups: first is ponies;
					second is heavy, or draft horses; and the last is light horses.
